# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Course 

Welcome to this **open-source educational project**, where we build step by step a practical system for **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The goal is to move from basic experiments to **production-ready applications** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## üìñ About this Course
This repository is part of a learning series focused on:
- Understanding the fundamentals of **RAG**.
- Connecting **LLMs** with external knowledge bases.
- Building applications that can **answer user questions based on documents**.
- Transitioning from prototypes to **real-world, deployable systems**.

## ‚ö° Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LLMs** (Large Language Models)
- **Vector Databases / Embeddings**
- **uv** for dependency and environment management (instead of pip)
